# Privacy Policy for Vantage LLM - Your AI Sidebar

**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026

Vantage LLM ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection and usage.

## 1. Data Collection

**Vantage LLM does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data.**

- **No Tracking:** We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any other telemetry tools to monitor your behavior.
- **No External Servers:** The extension does not communicate with any external servers owned by us. All settings (like your selected LLM) are stored locally on your device using the `chrome.storage.local` API.

## 2. Third-Party Services

Vantage LLM functions as a simplified interface (sidebar) for third-party AI services, including but not limited to:

- OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- Google (Gemini, AI Studio)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Perplexity AI
- DeepSeek

When you use these services through Vantage LLM, you are interacting directly with those third-party providers. Your data usage is governed by the respective privacy policies of those providers. We recommend reviewing their policies if you have concerns about how they handle your data.

## 3. Permissions Usage

- **sidePanel:** Used to display the extension interface alongside your web browser.
- **declarativeNetRequest:** Used to modify network headers (such as `X-Frame-Options`) strictly to allow the supported AI services to be displayed within the sidebar. No browsing data is read or recorded.
- **storage:** Used to save your UI preferences (e.g., which LLM you last selected).
- **browsingData:** Used internally by the browser to manage the sandboxed environment for the sidebar. We do not access your history or personal browsing data.
